# Daily-Journal
A simple web-based journaling application created with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB. Easily record and manage your daily thoughts and experiences.


# Project Overview:
This Daily Journal Web Project is a learning exercise that uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Lodash, Body-Parser, HTML, and CSS to create a simple web application for journaling. The primary goal of this project is to teach the process of creating a template-based web application using these technologies and deploying it to GitHub.

# Project Features:

- User Interface: The web application will have a clean and user-friendly interface for creating and viewing journal entries.
- Journal Entries: Users can create journal entries. Each entry will consist of a title and content.
- Template Engine (EJS): We will use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the template engine to dynamically generate HTML content with data from the server. 
- Express.js Backend: Express.js will be used to handle the backend of the journal entries.
- Lodash: Lodash will be used for utility functions and simplifying data manipulation.
- CSS Styling: The application will have CSS styles to make it visually appealing and responsive.
- Body-Parser Middleware: Body-Parser will be used to parse incoming HTTP requests, making it easier to handle form submissions.

# Project Structure:

- Public: This directory will contain static assets like CSS stylesheets.
- Views: EJS templates for rendering journal entries, a home page, a compose page, an about page, a contact page and a post page.
- App.js: The main application file where you set up the Express.js server and define routes.
- Package.json: The project's package configuration file with dependencies and scripts.

# Learning Objectives:

- Understand the basics of Node.js and Express.js for server-side development.
- Learn how to use EJS as a template engine to dynamically render HTML pages.
- Understanding how MongoDB and Mongoose works.
- Gain experience with Lodash for data manipulation.
- Practice using Body-Parser for handling form submissions.
